                    <p>Trish is just a humble waitress at the Fiction Dance Club and Bar...and also a mystical healer. She practices a form of ritualist magic that is similar to native american healing ceremonies except that her magic seems to actually work. She is incrediable protective when it comes to secrets about her past as well as who, or what she really is. Only Mason has learned the truth behind her mysterious past.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                    Trish has offered her medical assistance to the party, but she warns that they will need to bring her more supplies as she is running low on equipment.
