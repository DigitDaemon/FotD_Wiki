                    <p>Aria Raith is the current director of Snowblind Limited and a member of House Raith, an influential family of white court vampires. She takes a very hands on approach to managing those under her purview and takes an slights against them as a personal slight against herself. She is analytical and likes to have a lot of information before she makes any decesions. It is clear that she is not shy about leveraging her physical attractivness or her otherworldly powers to get what she wants, but often it is unnecesary for her to go so far as she is quite commanding or intimidating on her own.<br/><br/>Aria seems to prefer professnal dress, and despite making anything she puts on look sexy, doesn't take any extra effort to accentuate her unatural beauty. Her office and apartment are both open floor, giving the impression she likes to know what is going on...or seeing what is going on.</p>
