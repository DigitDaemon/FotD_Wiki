                <h2 id="evocation">Evocation:</h2>
                <p>Decide what you want to do: Attack, Shield, Gain Advantage, Counterspell</p>
                <h3>Attack:</h3>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>Decide how much power your spell needs: 2 shifts of power for each point of damage you want to do (you can split this damage between multiple targets); 2 additional shifts of power allows you to hit every creature in a zone with your spell. (SP)</li>
                    <li>Subtract your Spellcasting and stunt bonuses from the shift power total, you take Mental stress equal to that number + 1 (SP - Spellcasting - Stunt Bonuses + 1)(Min 1)</li>
                    <li>Roll your Will and subtract the roll from the power of the spell (SP - Will Roll = Overflow) [Enemies use the Will roll as the target to avoid the attack]</li>
                    <li>If there is positive Overflow, you can choose to either take the Overflow as physical stress or risk collateral damage around you based on the strength of the Overflow</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Shield:</h3>
                <p style="padding-left: 40px;">A Shield is an Evocation-based full defense that costs one mental stress. Make a Spellcasting roll at +2, as usual for a full defense. If an attack manages to inflict enough shifts to overcome your armor, the shield breaks and you cannot block attacks with it anymore. This spell lasts until it is dropped or broken at no additional stress cost, but you cannot take any action except defense while itâ€™s active.</p>
                <h3>Gain Advantage:</h3>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>Decide what you want to do, the GM will give you a cost for that effect. (SP)</li>
                    <li>Subtract your Spellcasting and Stunt bonuses from the shift power total, you take Mental stress equal to that number + 1 (SP - Spellcasting - Stunt Bonuses + 1)(Min 1)</li>
                    <li>There may be additional things depending on what effect you cause.</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Counterspell:</h3>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>Decide how much power your counterspell needs (Assessment roll). (SP)</li>
                    <li>Subtract your Spellcasting and Stunt Bonuses from the shift power total, you take Mental stress equal to that number + 1 (SP - Spellcasting - Stunt Bonuses + 1)(Min 1)</li>
                    <li>Roll your Will and subtract the roll from the power of the spell (SP - Will Roll = Overflow)</li>
                    <li>If there is positive Overflow, you can choose to either take the Overflow as physical stress or risk collateral damage around you based on the strength of the Overflow</li>

                <br>
                <h3>Paranet:</h3>
                <p>The Paranet is a global community of weaker magical talents that previously were preyed upon by larger magical threats. Through sharing of talent and information, members of the Paranet have been able to effectively take down magical threats and protect vulnerable people and communities though they rely to an extent on other local factions for protection like Harry Dresden or Johnny Marcone's gang in Chicago.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Snowblind Limited:</h3>
                <p>Snowblind is a corporate front for Winter's dealings in the greater part of Canada and the Northern US. Winter Fae are unable to deal with mortals directly, but the Winter Lady, Molly Carpenter has some leniency and the Winter Knight, Harry Dresden has no such restriction. Between the two of them pressuring the accorded nations into paying restitution to the citizens of Chicago, the Winter Court has taken some measures to stop something similar happening in the future. Official Snowblind is a cold weather research and development contractor, giving them the excuse for doing strange things in strange places all over the cold climate regions of North America.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Winter Court of Fairy:</h3>
                <p>The Winter Court is large and powerful. Like The Summer court it is controlled by the three Winter Queens: Mother Winter, Mab the Winter Queen, and Molly the Winter Lady. The winter fey are known for being perfect in their love of art and cruel and malicious in their treatment of mortals, representing death and the end of things. However the winter court is vital to the balance of the mortal world and an integral part of defending reality from what lies beyond the outer gates.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Summer Court of Fairy:</h3>
                <p>The Summer Court is not as large as the Winter Court but more direct in its involvement with mortal kind. Like the Winter Court it is controlled by the three Summer Queens:Mother Summer, Titania the Summer Queen and Lady Sarissa. The summer fey are warm and welcoming, encouraging growth and life. However, they can be just as dangerous as the winter fey, after all disease causing bacteria and poisonous flowers are alive as well. The Summer Court exists to balance the power of the Winter Court and to shield the mortal worlds from the worst of Winterâ€™s cruelty.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>White Court Vampires:</h3>
                <p>White vampires are loosely organized into the White Court. The White Court is currently ruled over by Lord Raith the head of House Raith with the two other large families being House Malvora and House Skavis. House Raith vampires learn to feed off lust, Malvora off of Fear and Skavis off of Despair. The large houses of the White court are in constant rivalry for power and the seat of ruler but tend to operate mostly with business dealings and corporate intrigue.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>White Council:</h3>
                <p>The White Council is the authority for mortal practitioners of magic. It is made up of all â€˜recognizedâ€™ wizards and strives to uphold and enforce the laws of magic in order to keep harmony with the natural world. The White Council is headed by the Senior Council and The Merlin (not the original Merlin). The White Council also has a surplus of powerful wizards at itâ€™s call to enforce and engage warlocks and supernatural threats known as Wardens. Wardens are distinguished by the anti magic swords they carry as well as a ubiquitous grey cloak.</p>

            <! ---Unseelie Accords--->
            <div>
                <h2 id="unseelie">Unseelie Accords (A Summary)</h2>
                <br>
                <p>The Unseelie accords are the â€˜Constitutionâ€™ of the supernatural world. They lay out how conflicts are to be handled, how debts are settled, and how factions treat one another in general. An important note, the accords are an agreement made out of necessity between groups that would be more than happy to see one another wiped off the earth, there is no negotiating in good faith where the accorded nations are concerned. Here are some important pieces though.</p>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>Trial by Champion: Nations are allowed to settle disagreements by providing a single champion to fight on behalf of the nation. The challenged nation provides three acceptable tests of strength and the challenger picks the one to be used from these three. Often the test involves combat in some way and often it is to the death.</li>
                    <li>Weregild: When a nationâ€™s personnel are unduly attacked, they may seek financial damages from the offending nation as an alternative to conflict.</li>
                    <li>Guestright: When someone of a different nation is explicitly offered hospitality, there is an understanding that the host will protect the guest from their own and outside forces and in return the guest will not attack the host or other guests. In the event that a guest nationâ€™s personnel breaks guestright, it may be satisfactory to the host that the guest nation disciplines said person, but ultimately it is up to the host.</li>

                <h2 id="laws-of-magic">Laws of Magic</h2>
                <br>
                <p>The laws of magic specifically apply to â€˜peopleâ€™ and do not govern how a practitioner uses magic when dealing with monsters.</p>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>Never Take a Life: Donâ€™t use magic to kill people.</li>
                    <li>Never Transform Another: Donâ€™t use magic to turn a person into something he/she/they are not</li>
                    <li>Never Invade the Thoughts of Another: Donâ€™t use magic to read peopleâ€™s minds</li>
                    <li>Never Enthrall Another: Donâ€™t use magic to change people's thoughts or control them</li>
                    <li>Never Reach Beyond the Borders of Life: Donâ€™t use Necromancy</li>
                    <li>Never Swim Against the Current of Time: Donâ€™t use magic to time travel</li>
                    <li>Never Seek Knowledge and Power from beyond the Outer Gates: To invite the outsiders into the mortal world is damnation for all reality</li>
