                    <p>Natasha Malvora, or Tassy to her friends, is an odd girl. She is repulsive but something about her, maybe her slightly too thin figure, or long arms and legs, or the dark shadows around her eyes paints a haunting aura around her. Of course, her gifts as a white court virgin don't hurt either. Tassy works mostly as a promoter and vendor for local music gigs and supernatural tourist locations, but she makes a significant amount on the side as well working for Snowblind LTD as an informant and espionage agent. 
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                    Despite how useful Tassy's ability to manipulate fear in her opponents is, it is clear that she is afraid of her own gifts. She distances herself from most mortals in order to keep them safe from her.
