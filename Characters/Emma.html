                    <p>Emma Blanches is a white court vampire assosiated with House Raith additionally, she serves as an enforcer for Snowblind Ltd. Outside of work, she plays bass in a punk rock band and frequents the Fiction Dance Club for food and <i>food</i>. Despite the grim nature of her work, she apears to make an effort to protect others and minimize the amount of harm that comes to innocents, whether they are caught in the path of a raging monster, or tangled in her bedsheets.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    The party has had a bit of a glimpse into Emma's personal life, having to deal with Emma's ex-boyfriend, and certifiable prick, Spencer Adams. They learned afterwards that Emma tends to reserve romantic <i>relationships</i> for people she finds distastful and doesn't mind causing some amount of <i>damage</i> to, but even then, she cuts things off with them before the permanent effects of a long term relationships with a white court vampire can be felt by her partner.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    It is uncertain how Emma really feals about her work at Snowblind Ltd and while she seems to be okay with the work, she is also subserveant to Aria Raith, the director of Snowblind, whether she wants to be or not. Aria seems to take a role as mentor, and family but also as a restraint on Emma's sometimes volitial emotions. It is clear, all other things considered, Emma is not happy about being a white court vampire, and sees herself as a monster playing at being human at the end of the day.</p>
